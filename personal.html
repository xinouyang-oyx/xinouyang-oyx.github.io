    <p>I'm a passionate Sagittarius with an endless curiosity for new experiencesâ€”anything unknown holds a special allure for me.</p>
    <p>I love badminton and regularly train, swim, and run. My passion for sports extends to rowing, hiking, and watching football. These activities are often a way to balance my intense love of food.</p>
    <p>I like to say I have a wide range of interests, but traveling and photography are undoubtedly my favorites. My travel photography has won several awards in small competitions, one of which hangs in the library of my undergraduate school.</p>
    <p>Beyond theoretical research, I value real-world engagement. I have conducted extensive field research in over 30 urban and rural communities across ten provinces in China. My practical experience includes training local government departments, direct participation in the development of national policy documents as a member of a think tank team, and consulting services for international organizations such as UNAIDS, the Gates Foundation, the International Committee of the Red Cross, UNICEF, and the United Nations Population Fund.</p>
