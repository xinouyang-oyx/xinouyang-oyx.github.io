<p>
  I'm a passionate Sagittarius with an endless curiosity for new experiences—anything unfamiliar feels like an adventure waiting to happen. 
  A devoted badminton addict, I also keep a steady routine of gym workouts, swimming, and running. 
  While still very much an amateur, I count finishing a half marathon and picking up a few school-level badminton trophies among my proudest sporting highlights. 
  Beyond the court and track, I find joy in rowing, hiking, and watching football. 
  All this exercise, of course, helps offset another obsession: food—especially anything spicy and the bold flavors of Chinese and Asian cuisines.

      <p>
        I like to say I have a wide range of interests, but traveling and photography are undoubtedly my favorites. 
        My travel photography has won several awards in small competitions, one of which hangs in the library of my undergraduate school.

      <p>
        Beyond theoretical research, I value real-world engagement. I have conducted extensive field research in over 30 urban and rural communities across ten provinces in China. 
        My practical experience includes training local government departments, direct participation in the development of national policy documents as a member of a think tank team, 
        and consulting services for international organizations such as UNAIDS, the Gates Foundation, the International Committee of the Red Cross, UNICEF, and the United Nations Population Fund.
