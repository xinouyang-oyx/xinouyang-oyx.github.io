        <h1>Xin Ouyang</h1>
        <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Institute of Economics, Tsinghua University and has been a visiting scholar at the Center for Labor and a Just Economy, Harvard University.</p>

        <p>My research focuses on technological innovation and identity-based inequality. Methodologically, I primarily use large, unique datasets for causal inference, supplemented by randomized controlled experiments and structural modeling.</p>

        <p><strong>Research Fields:</strong> Strategy Innovation; Organization Theory; Development Economics; Economic History<br>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>My philosophy is what drives innovation also drives division; what advances humanity also divides humanity. My research thus explores how rules and norms influence social inequality and the outcomes of technological innovation. I focus on two interrelated themes: (1) the institutional and behavioral drivers of social and economic inequality; and (2) the role of institutions and incentives in guiding innovation. A common interest in these areas is understanding how formal policies and informal practices can entrench disparities or promote transformative progress.</p>

    <p>I am also interested in understanding broader social phenomena and policy systems, applying empirical strategies to study human behavior and uncover social patterns. Currently, my additional projects investigate environmental, political, and urban development issues. Beyond these specific topics, I aim to explore deeper social mechanisms and phenomena, such as the divergence between objective outcomes and subjective perceptions, the differentiated effects of the same policy across top-down and bottom-up stages, and the choice and impacts of technological versus institutional governance.</p>

    <p>I am committed to building unique new datasets that not only benefit my own research but also have broader societal value. I have already established (and continue to expand) several large, unique datasets in the fields of innovation, labor, and economic history. I also welcome opportunities to acquire unique data through experiments, collaborations with businesses, and other organizations.</p>

      <span class="paper-title">Leading by Words: Evidence from xxx Oratory</span>
      <br><br>
      <span class="paper-text">This paper investigates how a charismatic leader’s oratory can catalyze political and social change. We assemble a new dataset of speeches linked to local outcomes, and employ several empirical strategies to identify the impact of exposure to oratory. The findings demonstrate that leaders’ speeches can influence political preferences, mobilize collective action, and shift media narratives. We expect this study will contribute to four strands of literature: leadership and charismatic influence, media economics and political communication, collective action and public goods provision, and historical political economy.</span>

    <h2>Personal</h2>
    <p>I'm a passionate Sagittarius with an endless curiosity for new experiences—anything unknown holds a special allure for me.</p>

    <p>I love badminton and regularly train, swim, and run. My passion for sports extends to rowing, hiking, and watching football. These activities are often a way to balance my intense love of food.</p>

    <p>I like to say I have a wide range of interests, but traveling and photography are undoubtedly my favorites. My travel photography has won several awards in small competitions, one of which hangs in the library of my undergraduate school.</p>

    <div class="personal-photo">

    </div>

    <p>Beyond theoretical research, I value real-world engagement. I have conducted extensive field research in over 30 urban and rural communities across ten provinces in China. My practical experience includes training local government departments, direct participation in the development of national policy documents as a member of a think tank team, and consulting services for international organizations such as UNAIDS, the Gates Foundation, the International Committee of the Red Cross, UNICEF, and the United Nations Population Fund.</p>
