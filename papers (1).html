    <p><b>Leading by Words: Evidence from xxx Oratory</b></p>
    <p>This paper investigates how a charismatic leader’s oratory can catalyze political and social change. We assemble a new dataset of speeches linked to local outcomes, and employ several empirical strategies to identify the impact of exposure to oratory. The findings demonstrate that leaders’ speeches can influence political preferences, mobilize collective action, and shift media narratives. We expect this study will contribute to four strands of literature: leadership and charismatic influence, media economics and political communication, collective action and public goods provision, and historical political economy.</p>
