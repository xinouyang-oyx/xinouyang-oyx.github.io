    <h2>Research</h2>

    <h3>Main Interests</h3>
    <p>
      My philosophy is what drives innovation also drives division; what advances humanity also divides humanity. 
      My research thus explores how rules and norms influence social inequality and the outcomes of technological innovation. 
      I focus on two interrelated themes: (1) the institutional and behavioral drivers of social and economic inequality; 
      and (2) the role of institutions and incentives in guiding innovation. 
      A common interest in these areas is understanding how formal policies and informal practices can entrench disparities 
      or promote transformative progress.
    </p>

    <h3>Additional Interests</h3>
    <p>
      I am also interested in understanding broader social phenomena and policy systems, applying empirical strategies 
      to study human behavior and uncover social patterns. 
      Currently, my additional projects investigate environmental, political, and urban development issues. 
      Beyond these specific topics, I aim to explore deeper social mechanisms and phenomena, 
      such as the divergence between objective outcomes and subjective perceptions, 
      the differentiated effects of the same policy across top-down and bottom-up stages, 
      and the choice and impacts of technological versus institutional governance.
    </p>

    <h3>Data</h3>
    <p>
      I am committed to building unique new datasets that not only benefit my own research but also have broader societal value. 
      I have already established (and continue to expand) several large, unique datasets in the fields of innovation, labor, 
      and economic history. 
      I also welcome opportunities to acquire unique data through collaborations and to leverage these resources 
      to advance both theoretical and applied research.
