  <h2>Job Market Paper</h2>
  <p>Leading by Words: Evidence from xxx Oratory 
  (with Letian Zhang, target the top economics journals).
  </p>
  <p>
  This paper investigates how a charismatic leader’s oratory can catalyze political and social change. 
  We assemble a new dataset of speeches linked to local outcomes, and employ several empirical strategies 
  to identify the impact of exposure to oratory. The findings demonstrate that leaders’ speeches can influence 
  political preferences, mobilize collective action, and shift media narratives. We expect this study will 
  contribute to four strands of literature: leadership and charismatic influence, media economics and political 
  communication, collective action and public goods provision, and historical political economy.
